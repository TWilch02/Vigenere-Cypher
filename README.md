# Vigenere-Cypher
Program that encrypts a plaintext file using the Vigenère cipher

Detailed Description:
This C code implements a program to encrypt a plaintext file using the Vigenère cipher.
The program takes two command-line arguments: the key file name and the plaintext (decrypted) file name. It reads the key and the plaintext, processes them, performs the encryption, and then prints the key, the processed plaintext, and the resulting ciphertext (encrypted text) to the terminal.
